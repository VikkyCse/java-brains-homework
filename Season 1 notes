Frontend vs Backend
The front end and back end of a web application refer to the different components that make up the overall system.

The front end, also known as the client-side, is the portion of the application that is responsible for the user interface and the way the user interacts with the application. It is what the user sees and interacts with when they visit a website. The front end is typically implemented using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It communicates with the back end to retrieve data and display it to the user, as well as to send user input to the back end for processing.

The back end, also known as the server-side, is responsible for the behind-the-scenes functionality of the application. It handles tasks such as processing user input, querying databases, performing calculations, and generating responses. The back end is typically implemented using languages such as Python, Ruby, or Java, and it may use technologies such as web frameworks, databases, and APIs.

In summary, the front end is responsible for the user interface, and how user interacts with the application, while the back end handles the application logic, calculations, database and server-side tasks.

The front end and back end communicate with each other using a variety of techniques, such as HTTP requests and responses. When a user interacts with a front-end feature of the website, such as a form submission, it sends an HTTP request to the server, the back-end, which then processes the data, interacts with the database if needed, and sends a response back to the front-end to be displayed to the user.


When a JavaScript client application makes an HTTP request to a Java back-end service, the following steps occur:

*.The JavaScript client application creates request object. This object contains information such as the method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT), the URL, and any data that needs to be sent with the request.
*.The JavaScript client sends the request to the server using the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API. This is an asynchronous operation, which means the JavaScript code will continue to execute while the request is being processed.
*.The request is received by the back-end service, which is typically implemented using a Java web framework such as Spring. The framework extracts the information from the request, such as the method and the URL, and routes it to the appropriate code in the back-end service.
*.The back-end service processes the request, which can include querying a database, performing calculations, or executing other logic.
*.The back-end service generates a response, which is typically in the form of an HTTP response object. The response contains information such as the status code (e.g. 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and any data that needs to be sent back to the client.
*.The response is sent back to the JavaScript client application. The JavaScript client receives the response and can process the data or update the user interface accordingly.
